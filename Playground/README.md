# Playground

These are the things that I'm testing on. Most of them are written C++.

I don't know whether they can be used one day, but I take much joy in writing them. Writing C++ code is like playing with LEGO bricks. Whatever, learning new things is always challenging and fun.

All the subfolders contain small demo projects or interesting topics that I'm making research on.
