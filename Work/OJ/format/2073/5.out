You may wonder why I use std::string_view here.
The reason is rather simple.
When you just want to hold a reference to a string,
but you don't want to modify it or copy it,
you can use std::string_view as const reference.
Why not const std::string &?
If you initialize from a const char *,
std::string_view will not allocate memory!
It is a light-weight reference to a string.
It provides a lot of useful functions, such as O(1) substr.
End! Hope to be useful for you!
